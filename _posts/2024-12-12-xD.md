## The Art of Anticipation

Defensive anticipation is one of football’s greatest, yet often overlooked, arts — the ability to read the game, disrupt danger, and turn chaos into control. Few players embodied this skill as profoundly as the legends captured in the photograph above: **Ronaldo Nazário**, surging forward with unmatched brilliance, and **Paolo Maldini** and **Fabio Cannavaro**, poised to neutralize the threat with their mastery of defensive timing and awareness.

This timeless battle of attack versus defense highlights a truth often missed: while attacking brilliance grabs the headlines, it’s the defenders who shape the game with their unseen, decisive interventions.

Building on the revolutionary work of **Sam Green’s Expected Goals (xG)**, **Karun Singh’s Expected Threat (xT)**, and **Sarah Rudd’s** pioneering Markov chain model, it’s time to extend this analytical rigor to defense. The **Expected Disruption (xD)** model does just that, shining a light on the subtle genius of defensive actions and their impact on the game.

---

## The Need for a New Defensive Metric

Traditional defensive statistics like tackles and interceptions provide raw counts but fail to capture the contextual value of these actions. A tackle in the opponent’s half isn’t equal to a last-ditch block inside the penalty area. Existing defensive metrics often lack the nuance required to assess a player’s true impact, treating all actions equally and ignoring the varying degrees of threat posed by different attacking moves.

**Key Questions:**
- How can we measure the effectiveness of a defender’s actions in terms of the threat they prevent?
- Can we assign a quantifiable value to defensive disruptions based on their location?

## Defensive Action Categories

To effectively measure defensive impact, it's crucial to categorize the different types of defensive actions players undertake. In this analysis, I consider **offsides, pressures, tackles, interceptions, ball recovery, blocks, dispossessed, goalkeeper actions (smother, collected crosses, punches, sweeper)**.

For each of these defensive actions, it is deemed **successful** if it leads to the defending team regaining possession of the ball. This contextual success is what the xD model aims to quantify, providing a more accurate measure of a player's defensive contributions.

---

## Building the Expected Disruption (xD) Model

### Data Utilized

For this analysis, we utilize data from the **2015/2016 season** across the **English Premier League, La Liga, Ligue 1, Bundesliga, and the Italian Serie A**. This comprehensive dataset allows us to capture a diverse range of defensive actions across top-tier European leagues.

### Dividing the Pitch into Zones

To start, we take a similar approach to Karun Singh’s xT model and **divide the pitch into 192 zones** with 12 zones across the width and 16 across the length. Each zone represents a specific area where defensive actions can occur. This spatial framework allows us to analyze actions relative to their location on the field.

---

## The Mathematical Model

The expected disruption value for a defensive action in zone \((x,y)\) is calculated using Equation (1) below:

$$
xD_{(x,y)} =
  \bigl(f_{(x,y)} \cdot s_{(x,y)}\bigr) 
  \;+\; 
  \Bigl(
    l_{(x,y)} 
    \cdot 
    \sum_{z=1}^{Z} \sum_{w=1}^{W} 
    T_{(x,y)\to(z,w)} \cdot xT_{(z,w)}
  \Bigr)
\tag{1}
$$

---

### Breaking It Down

1. **First Term:** \( f_{(x,y)} \cdot s_{(x,y)} \)

   - \(f_{(x,y)}\) is the probability of defensive actions in zone \((x,y)\) leading to successful disruption of shots taken from this zone.
   - \(s_{(x,y)}\) is the shot probability from zone \((x,y)\).

2. **Second Term:** 
   \[
     l_{(x,y)} 
     \cdot 
     \sum_{z=1}^{Z} \sum_{w=1}^{W} 
     T_{(x,y)\to(z,w)} \cdot xT_{(z,w)}
   \]

   - \(l_{(x,y)}\) is the probability of disrupting the ball from being moved from zone \((x,y)\).
   - \(T_{(x,y)\to(z,w)}\) represents the transition matrix storing the probability of a move from zone \((x,y)\) to zone \((z,w)\).
   - \(xT_{(z,w)}\) denotes the expected threat of moving the ball to destination zone \((z,w)\), adapted from Karun Singh’s xT model (based on 2015/2016 season data from Europe’s top 5 leagues).

---

Now that we have the model description out of the way, let’s look at what the xD matrix looks like. Below is a visualization of the xD values across different zones on the football pitch. Note, the direction of play is oriented from left to right.

<!-- Existing Interactive Plot -->

</iframe>

Hovering over each zone displays its specific xD value, indicating how defensive actions there influence the game by reducing the opponent’s chance of scoring within the next five actions—a concept inspired by Karun Singh’s xT model. The color intensity of each zone reflects the level of expected disruption, with lighter shades showing areas where defensive actions have a smaller impact.

The xD matrix assigns **higher values** to defensive actions performed **further up the pitch**, as disrupting play in these advanced areas significantly decreases the likelihood of the opponent converting possession into a scoring opportunity. Conversely, **actions closer to the defending team's own goal** have lower xD values because they are less likely to reduce the scoring threat. Despite the stark spatial variability in xD values, a player's xD score is elevated not just by **where** they act, but by **consistently executing effective defensive interventions** that neutralize threats and enhance their team's defensive performance.

---

## Why Top 10 Players Should Be Evaluated by Pitch Thirds

The nature of the xD matrix and the varying responsibilities of players across different positions mean that evaluating players solely on aggregate metrics can be misleading. Instead, it's more insightful to assess the top 10 players within each third of the pitch: **Defensive Third, Middle Third, and Attacking Third**.

**Rationale Behind This Approach:**
- **Role-Specific Expectations:** Goalkeepers, defenders, midfielders, and attackers have distinct defensive responsibilities. Comparing players within the same positional category provides a fair assessment based on similar roles and opportunities.
- **Spatial Responsibilities:** Defenders primarily operate in the defensive third, midfielders in the middle third, and attackers in the attacking third. Evaluating them within these zones aligns with their natural areas of influence.

---

## Scatter Plot: xD per 90 vs. Defensive Actions per 90

To justify this evaluation approach, we present a scatter plot illustrating the relationship between **Defensive Actions per 90 Minutes** and **xD per 90 Minutes** across all top 5 leagues.

![Scatter Plot]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/xD_barcharts/all_leagues_defensive_scatter_plot.png){:.chart-image}

The scatter plot above vividly illustrates the distinct defensive profiles of defenders, midfielders, and attackers based on their **xD per 90 minutes** and **Defensive Actions per 90 minutes**.

- **Defenders** typically execute a high number of defensive actions closer to their goal where xD values are lower because the probability of conceding is still higher close to the defending team’s goal. Despite the lower xD per 90 minutes, their consistent involvement steadily contributes to their overall xD.
- **Midfielders** maintain a balanced number of defensive actions with moderate xD per 90 minutes, reflecting their pivotal role in both disrupting play and transitioning the ball. Their strategic positioning enables them to perform meaningful defensive actions in moderately high-value zones.
- **Attackers** perform fewer defensive actions but achieve higher xD per 90 minutes by concentrating in high xD zones near the opponent's goal. Their elevated xD scores result from the quality and frequency of their defensive interventions in these critical areas.

---

## Limitations of the xD per 90 Metric

While the xD per 90 metric offers valuable insights into a player's defensive impact, it has notable limitations:

1. **Positional Bias:** Players in different positions naturally have varying opportunities to perform defensive actions, leading to disparities in xD scores. For example, defenders typically engage in more defensive plays than attackers, but attackers perform theirs in higher xD regions, thus skewing raw xD comparisons across roles.

2. **Frequency vs. Quality:** A high xD per action may result from infrequent but impactful defensive plays, whereas frequent defensive actions with lower xD values might not accurately reflect a player's overall defensive contribution.

To overcome these challenges, I believe the **xD (Possession Adjusted)** metric is more appropriate. By normalizing xD based on a team's possession statistics, we can account for the differing levels of defensive opportunities across positions and playing styles. This adjustment provides a more equitable and accurate assessment of a player's defensive effectiveness, ensuring fairer comparisons regardless of their role or team’s possession dynamics.

### Why Adjust for Possession?

Teams with lower possession may naturally have more opportunities to perform defensive actions, potentially inflating xD scores. Adjusting for possession ensures that the xD metric accurately reflects a player's defensive impact relative to their team's control of the ball.

## Evaluating Players from the English Premier League (EPL)

Focusing on evaluating players from the **English Premier League (EPL)** during the **2015/2016 season**, we delve deeper into the defensive performances within a single league, providing a clearer picture of player contributions.

The charts below highlight the **top 10 players in each third of the pitch** based on their **possession-adjusted xD (Expected Disruption)**. This metric evaluates a player’s defensive contributions relative to their team’s possession, ensuring fair comparisons across different teams and styles of play. The length of the horizontal bars represents the total xD for the season, derived from key possession-winning actions such as tackles, ball recoveries, blocks, interceptions, dispossessions, and pressures.

Interestingly, while a player’s total xD might place them high on the chart, their possession-adjusted xD accounts for the overall opportunities within their team structure. This dynamic sheds light on individual brilliance, regardless of whether they played for title-winning sides or relegation battlers. Let’s take a closer look at the breakdowns by pitch thirds.

### Top 10 Players in the Defensive Third

![Defensive Third]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/xD_barcharts/top10_xD_possAdj_defensive_third_wlogo.png){:.chart-image}

Defensive actions in the defensive third were dominated by **ball recoveries (roughly 40% of total xD)** and **blocks (30%)**. The xD values in this zone are generally lower, reflecting the higher probability of conceding near a team's own goal.

- **Scott Dann (Crystal Palace)** stands out for his stellar defensive contributions. Ball recoveries accounted for 14.1% of his total xD, while his blocking ability added another 11.2%.
- **Christian Fuchs and Wes Morgan (Leicester City)** were pillars of their extraordinary backline, exemplifying Leicester’s mantra of resilience.
- **Virgil van Dijk (Southampton)** was already showcasing his world-class potential, demonstrating calmness on the ball and impeccable reading of the game.

### Top 10 Players in the Middle Third

![Middle Third]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/xD_barcharts/top10_xD_possAdj_middle_third_wlogo.png){:.chart-image}

The middle third saw ball recoveries dominate the xD breakdown, accounting for **over 50%** of total contributions, followed by interceptions (15%) and tackles (10%).

- **N’Golo Kanté (Leicester City)**: Ball recoveries accounted for an astounding 17.6% of his xD.
- **Danny Drinkwater (Leicester City)**: Boasted the highest share of ball recoveries among the top 10 players (22.1%).
- **Idrissa Gana Gueye (Aston Villa)**: Despite his team’s relegation, he showcased immense defensive ability.

### Top 10 Players in the Attacking Third

![Attacking Third]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/xD_barcharts/top10_xD_possAdj_attacking_third_wlogo.png){:.chart-image}

In the attacking third, xD values are significantly higher, reflecting the **high-stakes nature** of defensive actions near the opponent’s goal.

- **Troy Deeney (Watford)** led the list, contributing heavily through ball recoveries and blocks.
- **Jamie Vardy (Leicester City)** was the poster boy for high-intensity pressing.
- **Odion Ighalo (Watford)** and **Sadio Mané (Southampton)** showcased dual-threat qualities, combining defensive actions with attacking output.

## Leicester’s Year, But Not Theirs Alone

The 2015/2016 season wasn’t just about Leicester’s dream run—it was a stage for players who shaped the game beyond that one magical year. Scott Dann gave Crystal Palace a fighting chance, N’Golo Kanté redefined midfield control, and Troy Deeney showed the value of relentless effort in the attacking third. For some, like Virgil van Dijk and Sadio Mané, this season was a stepping stone to even greater heights.
