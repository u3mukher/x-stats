## Quantifying the unseen impact of defensive actions on the pitch

### **Why Defense Deserves More Credit?**

In the beautiful game of soccer, attacking brilliance often steals the spotlight. Goals win matches, and the metrics to measure offensive prowess are plentiful — **Expected Goals (xG)**, **Expected Assists (xA)**, and **Expected Threat (xT)**, to name a few. But what about the art of defense? How do we quantify the subtle, game-changing moments when a defender intercepts a pass, blocks a shot, or disrupts the flow of an attack?

### **The Need for a New Defensive Metric**

Traditional defensive statistics like tackles and interceptions provide raw counts but fail to capture the contextual value of these actions. A tackle in the opponent’s half isn’t equal to a last-ditch block inside the penalty area. Existing defensive metrics often lack the nuance required to assess a player’s true impact, treating all actions equally and ignoring the varying degrees of threat posed by different attacking moves.

To bridge this gap, I propose the **Expected Disruption (xD)** model — a framework designed to quantify the impact of defensive actions on preventing scoring opportunities. Just as the [xT model](https://karun.in/blog/expected-threat.html) (by Karun Singh) revolutionized our understanding of buildup play by assigning value to each offensive action, the xD model aims to provide a similar advancement for defensive analysis.

**Key Questions:**
•	How can we measure the effectiveness of a defender’s actions in terms of the threat they prevent?
•	Can we assign a quantifiable value to defensive disruptions based on their location?
