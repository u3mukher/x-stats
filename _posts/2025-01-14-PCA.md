# Introduction

As transfer fees soar, evaluating whether a player’s style fits a team’s tactics has become critical. Analysts have developed data-driven tools that go beyond goals and assists to assess playing styles and compatibility. For example, [Decroos and Davis (2019)](https://ecmlpkdd2019.org/downloads/paper/701.pdf) introduced player vectors to compare styles and track development, while [Pappalardo et al. (2019)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3343172) created PlayeRank to evaluate players based on their roles and contributions. The Twenty First Group uses advanced models to assess player value and style, aiding smarter transfer decisions.

[Player embedding using UMAP by Charles William](https://opengoalapp.github.io/Player-Embedding-With-UMAP/) simplifies large datasets to reveal patterns. Inspired by such methods, I explored whether Principal Component Analysis (PCA) could uncover insights into playing styles and player-team fit. PCA condenses complex metrics into a few dimensions, capturing differences like possession, dribbling, or direct play, offering a starting point for evaluating compatibility.

While tools like PCA highlight trends, they work best alongside traditional scouting to capture tactical and psychological nuances. This analysis uses PCA to examine player-team fit while considering football’s broader complexities.

## Why I Use PCA & My Goal

I chose Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as it simplifies complex datasets while uncovering valuable patterns:

1. **Reduces Complexity:** PCA condenses a large set of metrics into just a few principal components—dimensions or axes that represent the most important differences across players and teams.  
2. **Reveals Patterns:** It helps identify similarities and differences between teams and players—like whether a player is dribble-heavy, a consistent passer, or leans more on defensive contributions.

My goal is to uncover these broad stylistic traits and visualize how players and teams compare. By mapping everyone into the same PCA space, I can measure how closely their styles align, giving us a clearer picture of player-team compatibility.

## Data & Metrics Overview

### How PCA Works

Imagine you’re sorting a massive pile of football stickers with different traits—some are shiny, colorful, big, or small. Instead of focusing on every detail, PCA helps you find the most important patterns, like grouping stickers into “bright vs. dull” or “big vs. small.” These patterns, called **principal components**, make it easier to see what really matters.

Now think about football metrics—things like passes, shots, and dribbles. Players and teams have so many numbers that it’s overwhelming to compare them. PCA simplifies this by finding the main ways players and teams differ. For example:

- It might show how players balance dribbling and shooting versus focusing on passing.  
- It could also highlight how teams vary between possession-heavy styles and quick counterattacks.

The result of PCA is a set of new numbers (coordinates) for each player or team in a smaller space. These numbers represent how they fit into the big patterns identified by PCA. Think of it like reducing a 14-metric puzzle into just two or three key pieces, which makes it much easier to compare players or teams and group them by similar styles.

---

### Metrics I’m Using

For this analysis, I used match event data provided by StatsBomb to evaluate the 2015/2016 season across the top five European leagues—Premier League, Serie A, La Liga, Bundesliga, and Ligue 1. The following **13 metrics** were calculated at both the player level and the team level to capture individual and collective styles of play:

1. **Possession:** The percentage of game time the team controlled the ball while the player was on the pitch.  
2. **Pass Completion Rate:** The percentage of successful passes out of all passes attempted.  
3. **xG per 90:** Expected Goals per 90 minutes, indicating how likely a player’s shots were to result in goals.  
4. **Shots per 90:** Total shots attempted per 90 minutes.  
5. **Key Passes per 90:** Passes leading directly to a shot per 90 minutes.  
6. **Dribbles per 90:** Successful dribbles per 90 minutes.  
7. **Duel Success Rate:** The percentage of physical challenges (like tackles and aerial duels) won by the player.  
8. **Interceptions per 90:** The number of successful interceptions per 90 minutes.  
9. **Fouls Committed per 90:** Total fouls committed per 90 minutes.  
10. **Progressive Passes per 90:** Passes that move the ball significantly closer to the opponent’s goal.  
11. **Set Piece xG per 90:** Expected Goals from set-piece shots like free kicks and corners, scaled to 90 minutes.  
12. **Player Pass Length Avg:** The average length of completed passes (in yards).  
13. **Counterattacks per 90:** Shots resulting from counterattacks per 90 minutes.

To account for differences in league strength, all metrics were transformed into **percentile ranks**. For example, a player in the 90th percentile for xG per 90 performed better in that area than 90% of the players in the dataset.

While this analysis focuses on these 13 metrics, there are many others that could provide further insights. For example, metrics like pressures in the attacking third, ball recoveries, cross completion rate, etc. For now, I’ve chosen these metrics as a balanced starting point that covers attacking, passing, defensive, and tactical contributions effectively.

---

### Building the PCA Space

After converting metrics into percentile ranks, I combined player and team data into a single dataset, ensuring consistent metric definitions. This dataset forms a large matrix where each row represents a player or team, and each column corresponds to one of the 13 metrics.

Using PCA, I identified the main patterns in this data, called **principal components (PCs)**. Each PC is a linear combination of the original metrics, weighted by their contributions (**loadings**). These loadings indicate how strongly each metric influences the principal component, similar to coefficients in a regression model. For example, PC1 can be expressed as:

PC1 = 0.9474 * (Progressive Passes per 90) + 0.1937 * (Fouls Committed per 90) + ...

Here are the loadings for the **first two principal components**:

- **PC1 (92.3% Variance):**
  - Progressive Passes per 90: +0.9474 (dominant contribution)
  - Fouls Committed per 90: +0.1937
  - Shots per 90: +0.1624
  - Dribbles per 90: +0.1219
  - Key Passes per 90: +0.1077
  - Interceptions per 90: +0.0947
  - Player Pass Length Avg: +0.0528
  - xG per 90: +0.0163 (insignificant)
  - Set Piece xG per 90: +0.0084 (insignificant)
  - Counterattacks per 90: +0.0070 (insignificant)

  PC1 primarily reflects **progressive passing**. Metrics like xG, set-piece xG, and counterattacks contribute minimally and do not significantly influence this dimension.

- **PC2 (6.3% Variance):**
  - Player Pass Length Avg: +0.9795 (dominant contribution)
  - Shots per 90: -0.1400
  - Dribbles per 90: -0.0949
  - Fouls Committed per 90: -0.0801
  - Key Passes per 90: -0.0707
  - xG per 90: -0.0177 (insignificant)
  - Duel Success Rate: +0.0111 (insignificant)
  - Counterattacks per 90: -0.0100 (insignificant)
  - Set Piece xG per 90: -0.0075 (insignificant)
  - Progressive Passes per 90: +0.0064 (insignificant)

  PC2 is overwhelmingly driven by **average pass length**, distinguishing between shorter and longer passing styles. Most other metrics, such as xG and counterattacks, have negligible influence.

#### Why Some Metrics are Insignificant

PCA focuses on the patterns that explain the most variance in the data. Metrics with small loadings, such as xG per 90 and set-piece xG per 90, contribute little to the primary differences between playing styles and therefore have minimal impact on the axes.

## Visualizing the PCA Results

<figure class="chart-image">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/PCA_Space/pca_space_highlighted.png" alt="PCA Space" />
  <figcaption>
    PCA scatterplot visualizing player and team playing styles. Data points are clustered into three groups: blue (more 
    balanced/defensive players), orange (teams), and green (attacking players). Players are represented by circles, teams 
    by squares. The positions of Gerard Piqué (Center Back) and Barcelona (lower in the blue cluster and far right in the 
    orange cluster) exemplify a short, progressive passing style, while Gareth McAuley (Center Back) and West Brom (higher 
    in the blue cluster and far left in the orange cluster) demonstrate a long, less progressive passing approach.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

## Interpreting the PCA Scatterplot

This scatterplot illustrates how players and teams align along two key dimensions identified through Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The x-axis (PC1) represents the spectrum of progressive versus less progressive passing. Players and teams positioned further to the right emphasize advancing the ball forward through passes, while those on the left lean toward a less progressive or more direct approach. The y-axis (PC2) captures passing style, contrasting short versus long passes. Higher values on this axis indicate a preference for long passes, whereas lower values reflect a tendency toward shorter, intricate passing styles.

**Highlighted Examples:**

*   **Gerard Piqué (Barcelona):** Positioned lower on the scatterplot, Piqué exemplifies Barcelona’s possession-heavy approach, characterized by short, progressive passes that control the game and advance play. Barcelona, as a team, is located at the far right of the orange cluster, reflecting their strong emphasis on progressive passing.
*   **Gareth McAuley (West Bromwich Albion):** Found higher on the scatterplot, McAuley reflects West Brom’s direct style, focusing on long passes to quickly transition the ball forward. West Brom, as a team, is positioned at the far left of the orange cluster, underscoring their less progressive and more direct passing approach.

Their teams also align with these playing styles, showcasing the tactical consistency between individual players and their clubs.

**A Caveat: No Position-Based Clustering**

While this analysis effectively groups players and teams based on playing style, it does not explicitly cluster by position (e.g., defenders, midfielders, attackers). As a result, players in similar positions but with contrasting styles (e.g., Piqué vs. McAuley) appear far apart. Future analyses could incorporate position-specific clustering to add more granularity to these insights.

## Introducing the 2015/2016 Transfers

To put this approach into practice, I analyzed several notable transfers from the 2015/2016 season, evaluating how well players’ styles matched their new teams. These include:

*   **Defenders:**
    *   Šime Vrsaljko (from Sassuolo to Atlético Madrid)
    *   Shkodran Mustafi (from Valencia to Arsenal)
    *   Raphaël Guerreiro (from Lorient to Dortmund)
*   **Attackers:**
    *   Memphis Depay (from Manchester United to Lyon)
    *   Sadio Mané (from Southampton to Liverpool)
    *   Ousmane Dembélé (from Rennes to Dortmund)
*   **Midfielders:**
    *   Miralem Pjanić (from AS Roma to Juventus)
    *   Paul Pogba (from Juventus to Manchester United)
    *   İlkay Gündoğan (from Dortmund to Manchester City)

**Šime Vrsaljko – LaLiga & Atlético Madrid**

<figure class="chart-image">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/PCA_Transfers/VRSALJKO.jpg" alt="PCA Space" />
  <figcaption>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Vrsaljko’s move to Atlético Madrid from Sassuolo was a notable transfer, and the PCA results provide an interesting perspective on how well his playing style aligned with his new team.

Distance-Based PCA Ranking

<figure class="chart-image">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/PCA_Ranks/side_by_side_Šime_Vrsaljko_Atlético_Madrid_LaLiga.png" alt="PCA Space" />
  <figcaption>
    (Left) Distances of LaLiga teams from Vrsaljko (excluding Sassuolo), with Atlético Madrid highlighted; (Right) Top 10 
    teams across the top five leagues.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

In LaLiga, Real Betis (2.654) and Real Sociedad (3.083) posted slightly closer distances to Vrsaljko than Atlético Madrid (3.125). However, Atlético still ranked among the top three matches for him within the league. When looking across the top five European leagues, Atlético placed 7th in rank, indicating a strong stylistic alignment, even though some clubs like Bordeaux or Montpellier had slightly smaller distances.

These rankings are derived from PCA, which converts player and team metrics into percentile scores (e.g., team dribbles per 90 or interceptions per 90) and measures the distance between percentile profiles. In simplified terms:

*   PCA compares profiles by placing both player and team percentile vectors into a multi-dimensional space, where each metric is a dimension.
*   The distance between two profiles reflects how closely the player’s metrics align with the team’s. A smaller distance suggests a better stylistic fit, while a larger distance points to more differences.

Combining the PCA Scatterplot and Bar Charts

<figure class="chart-image">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/PCA_Space/pca_space_highlighted_Vrsaljko.png" alt="PCA Space" />
  <figcaption>
    PCA Scatterplot showing the relative location of the top three teams in LaLiga from Vrsaljko.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

The PCA scatterplot above provides a helpful overview of playing styles and relative distances. For instance, highlighting Real Betis, Real Sociedad, and Atlético Madrid on the scatterplot shows how these teams cluster in the progressive vs. direct and short vs. long passing dimensions. As defenders, both Piqué (as seen in the earlier scatter plot) and Vrsaljko fall within the blue cluster. However, Vrsaljko is positioned noticeably lower than Piqué, suggesting a slightly more direct style, perhaps incorporating longer passes or more frequent forward runs. This highlights how variations in individual metrics can influence a player's position, even within a similar cluster. It's crucial to understand that, like looking at shadows of 3D objects on a wall, visual proximity on the PCA scatterplot can be misleading; similar-looking "shadows" (points on the plot) don't guarantee similar underlying "objects" (players/teams with all their metrics). Points that appear closer don't necessarily represent the closest overall stylistic matches when considering all individual metrics. The PCA distance values shown through the bar charts provide a more accurate measure of overall stylistic similarity. The scatterplot is best used for broad trend analysis, while distance value bar charts provide the necessary precision for detailed comparisons.

To dive deeper, we will use grouped bar charts to break down individual metrics, illustrating exactly where Vrsaljko’s style aligns or diverges from Atlético’s. By combining the scatterplot and bar charts, we can better understand both the overall trends and specific details of the match.

Comparative Metrics Overview

<figure class="chart-image">

  <figcaption>
    (Left) Percentile bar chart of metrics: Vrsaljko vs. Atlético Madrid; (Right) Table of raw metric values
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Several metrics highlight areas of alignment and divergence between Vrsaljko and Atlético Madrid:

*   **Possession & Pass Accuracy:**

    Vrsaljko demonstrated a moderate-to-high possession percentile, suggesting comfort on the ball. Atlético’s percentile was slightly lower, reflecting their counter-focused, mid-block style under Diego Simeone.

    Both had solid pass completion rates, but Atlético’s percentile lagged behind top possession teams. This may have increased the PCA distance if Vrsaljko had become accustomed to a more methodical buildup at Sassuolo.

*   **Defensive Engagement:**

    *   **Interceptions per 90:** Vrsaljko ranked at 69.2%, while Atlético excelled at 93.9%, reflecting their disciplined positioning and tendency for timely interceptions. This alignment reduced the PCA distance and highlighted Vrsaljko’s compatibility with Atlético’s system.
    *   **Fouls Committed per 90:** Vrsaljko’s percentile (87.4%) was higher than Atlético’s (53.1%), suggesting Vrsaljko concedes fewer fouls. Conversely, Atlético’s tactical fouling was more frequent, slightly widening the PCA distance.

*   **Forward Contributions:**

    *   **Dribbles per 90:** Vrsaljko’s percentile (67.7%) was lower than Atlético’s (96.9%), likely reflecting the team’s reliance on attacking players for dribble-heavy opportunities.
    *   **Shots per 90 & xG per 90:** Vrsaljko’s output in these metrics was moderate, while Atlético’s high team percentiles suggested robust attacking support from multiple players.

These areas of alignment in defense (e.g., interceptions) and minor mismatches (e.g., fouls or dribble volume) collectively shaped the PCA distance.

**Vrsaljko’s Time at Atlético Madrid**

Despite the PCA showing Atlético Madrid as a strong but not perfect match, Vrsaljko adapted well to Simeone’s system when fit. His strengths, such as ball-carrying ability and solid defensive reading, complemented Atlético’s disciplined style. However, injuries and competition for starting spots occasionally limited his playing time. When on the pitch, Vrsaljko’s percentile-based strengths, such as his interceptions and possession comfort, meshed effectively with the team’s approach.

## Shkodran Mustafi – Premier League & Arsenal

<figure class="chart-image">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/PCA_Transfers/Mustafi.jpg" alt="PCA Space" />
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

Shkodran Mustafi’s move to Arsenal from Valencia in 2016 provided an interesting case for evaluating stylistic alignment. While PCA highlights some of his strengths, it also reveals significant mismatches with Arsenal’s playing style under Arsène Wenger.

## Distance-Based PCA Ranking

<figure class="chart-image">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/PCA_Ranks/side_by_side_Shkodran_Mustafi_Arsenal_Premier_League.png" alt="PCA Space" />
  <figcaption>
    (Left) Distances of Premier League teams from Mustafi (excluding Valencia); (Right) Top 10 teams across the top five leagues.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Among Premier League teams, Manchester United (2.760) emerged as Mustafi’s closest stylistic match. However, Arsenal’s distance of 6.002 placed it near the bottom of Mustafi’s compatibility list within the league. Across the top five leagues, Arsenal ranked 76th, suggesting a notable gap in percentile-based profiles between Mustafi and the Gunners.

These rankings highlight broad patterns of alignment, but the distance values alone don’t explain the full story. To better understand where Mustafi’s playing style diverged from Arsenal’s system, we can examine specific metrics that contributed to these differences.

## Comparative Metrics Overview

<figure class="chart-image">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/PCA_Metrics/global_percentile_comparison_ShkodranMustafi_Arsenal.png" alt="PCA Space" />
  <figcaption>
    (Left) Percentile bar chart of metrics: Mustafi’s metric percentiles vs. Arsenal; (Right) Table of raw metric values.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Several metrics reveal where Mustafi’s style diverged significantly from Arsenal’s collective approach:

*   **Possession & Pass Completion:**

    *   Mustafi’s possession percentile (~16.3%) was significantly lower than Arsenal’s 91.8%, indicating he was accustomed to a reactive, mid-tier ball-control setup at Valencia. In contrast, Arsenal’s philosophy under Wenger leaned heavily on dominating possession.
    *   Similarly, Mustafi’s pass completion rate (~66.0%) lagged behind Arsenal’s 90.8%, reflecting the Gunners’ preference for short-passing sequences. This gap in possession and passing style inflated the PCA distance.

*   **Defensive Attributes:**

    *   *Interceptions per 90:* Mustafi excelled with a percentile of 98.7%, demonstrating his ability to anticipate and cut out danger. Arsenal’s team percentile of 71.4%, while respectable, reflects a collective defensive style more reliant on controlling the game through possession than making interceptions.
    *   *Duel Success & Fouls:* Mustafi’s metrics for fouls and duels were average for his role. Arsenal’s approach, influenced by their pressing and possession game, likely skewed their collective percentile slightly higher but did not align perfectly with Mustafi’s skill set.

*   **Shot/Attacking Metrics:**

    *   Mustafi’s shot per 90 (~63.5%) and xG per 90 (~65.8%) percentiles suggest a willingness to contribute offensively, an unusual trait for a center-back. Arsenal’s high team percentiles in these metrics (88.8% for shots and 92.9% for xG) indicate a system that generated significant attacking output across the pitch, which didn’t naturally complement Mustafi’s defensive strengths.

These discrepancies, particularly in possession and passing, explain why Arsenal appeared near the lower end of Mustafi’s stylistic matches.

## Mustafi’s Time at Arsenal

Mustafi’s high percentile for interceptions made him well-suited to a deeper, more counter-focused back line, like the one he experienced at Valencia. However, Arsenal’s high defensive line and possession-oriented demands posed a challenge for him. Errors and inconsistent adaptation plagued his tenure, often highlighting the stylistic mismatch between his natural tendencies and Arsenal’s tactical requirements.

The PCA results align with these challenges, illustrating how significant gaps in possession and passing styles can make it difficult for even a talented defender to integrate into a ball-dominant structure.

## Raphaël Guerreiro – Bundesliga & Borussia Dortmund

<figure class="chart-image">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/PCA_Transfers/Guerreiro_2.jpg" alt="PCA Space" />
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

Raphaël Guerreiro’s transfer to Borussia Dortmund in 2016 was a significant move, and the PCA analysis sheds light on how his playing style compared to Dortmund’s approach. While the results suggest Dortmund wasn’t his closest stylistic match, Guerreiro’s individual strengths aligned well with their system in key areas.

## Distance-Based Ranking

<figure class="chart-image">

  </figcaption>
</figure>

Breaking down specific metrics reveals areas of alignment and divergence between Guerreiro and Borussia Dortmund:

*   **Possession & Passing:**

    *   *Possession:* Guerreiro’s percentile (87.0%) reflects a strong preference for controlling the ball, aligning well with Dortmund’s 96.9%, which ranks them among the top possession-oriented teams.
    *   *Pass Completion Rate:* Guerreiro’s percentile (76.5%) is solid but slightly lower than Dortmund’s 93.9%, highlighting the team’s elite passing accuracy.

*   **Per-90 Action Metrics:**

    *   *Dribbles per 90:* Guerreiro’s rate (1.500, 93.2%) suggests strong individual dribbling ability, while Dortmund’s collective rate (9.737, 67.3%) reflects moderate reliance on dribbling, likely distributed across multiple players.
    *   *Progressive Passes per 90:* Guerreiro’s percentile (73.0%) is commendable, but Dortmund’s 98.0% showcases their intense forward-passing style, ranking them in the top 2% of teams globally.
    *   *Shots per 90 & xG per 90:* Guerreiro’s 1.235 shots (79.7%) and 0.075 xG (69.2%) contrast with Dortmund’s 14.962 shots (91.8%) and 2.203 xG (99.0%), emphasizing Dortmund’s high-volume attacking output.

*   **Defensive Contributions:**

    *   *Duel Success Rate:* Guerreiro excelled with 94.8%, demonstrating strong one-on-one capabilities, compared to Dortmund’s 69.4%, which reflects a more collective approach.
    *   *Interceptions per 90:* Guerreiro’s 91.6% indicates a strong reading of the game, while Dortmund’s low 6.1% suggests they rely more on pressing triggers than traditional interceptions. This difference contributes to the PCA distance.

Both Guerreiro and Dortmund share attacking, possession-heavy playstyles, but differences in percentile rankings for metrics like progressive passes per 90 and interceptions per 90 create a moderate PCA distance.

## Guerreiro’s Time at Borussia Dortmund

Despite PCA suggesting slightly closer matches at clubs like Mönchengladbach or Leverkusen, Guerreiro quickly adapted to Dortmund’s system under managers like Thomas Tuchel. His high dribbling ability, duel success, and possession comfort translated well into their high-possession, attacking approach. Over time, he adjusted to Dortmund’s elite passing accuracy and high-pressing system, demonstrating how a versatile player can succeed even with a moderate PCA distance.

  </figcaption>
</figure>

Examining specific metrics reveals both alignment and divergence between Depay’s playing style and Lyon’s approach:

*   **Possession & Pass Accuracy:**

    *   *Possession:* Depay’s 36.2% percentile reflects his experience in a less ball-dominant system at Manchester United. In contrast, Lyon’s 94.9% percentile underscores their high-possession approach, widening the PCA distance.
    *   *Pass Completion Rate:* Depay’s 39.7% percentile falls below Lyon’s 89.8%, emphasizing Lyon’s control-oriented, short-passing style compared to Depay’s more direct tendencies.

*   **Per-90 Offensive & Defensive Metrics:**

    *   *Dribbles per 90:* Depay’s percentile (86.5%) highlights his strong one-on-one ability. Lyon’s collective percentile (55.1%) suggests their dribbling contributions were spread across the squad, rather than concentrated in a single player.
    *   *Shots per 90:* Depay’s 92.7% underscores his inclination to shoot, aligning well with Lyon’s 85.7%, which reflects an attacking mindset.
    *   *xG per 90:* Depay’s 86.0% and Lyon’s 87.8% percentiles further highlight strong goal involvement on both ends, keeping their profiles closely aligned.

*   **Counterattacks & Key Passes:**

    *   *Counterattacks per 90:* Depay’s percentile (92.0%) reflects his comfort in fast transitions. Lyon’s 52.0%, while lower, suggests a more balanced approach that doesn’t heavily rely on counters.
    *   *Key Passes per 90:* Depay’s 53.4% is moderate compared to Lyon’s 87.8%, reflecting the team’s collective strength in creating chances versus Depay’s individual contributions.

Lyon’s high percentile ranks in possession and passing completion increased the PCA distance slightly, but shared attributes like dribbling, shots, and xG kept their profiles relatively close.

## Depay’s Rejuvenation at Lyon

Depay’s move to Lyon proved transformative. Despite moderate mismatches in areas like possession and pass accuracy, his strengths—dribbling and shooting—translated seamlessly into Lyon’s attack-minded system. Playing as a wide forward or secondary striker, Depay quickly became a key figure, demonstrating how a team’s emphasis on final-third actions can complement a player’s individual skills.

    *   *Possession:* Mané’s 42.5% percentile reflects decent ball retention without being heavily possession-based. Liverpool’s 82.7% percentile is higher, but not so extreme as to create a significant PCA gap.
    *   *Pass Completion Rate:* Mané’s 62.3% and Liverpool’s 74.5% both rank above average, showing similar tendencies in passing, with Liverpool leaning slightly more toward short-passing sequences.

*   **Per-90 Offensive & Defensive Metrics:**

    *   *Dribbles per 90:* Mané’s 2.162 dribbles (98.1%) highlight his elite take-on ability. Liverpool’s collective percentile (82.7%) reflects a similar emphasis on dribbling as part of their attacking thrust.
    *   *Shots per 90 & xG per 90:* Mané’s 2.324 shots (96.0%) and 0.326 xG (96.9%) emphasize his goal-scoring potential, closely matching Liverpool’s high values (95.9% for shots and 84.7% for xG).

*   **Counterattacks & Key Passes:**

    *   *Counterattacks per 90:* Mané’s 99.9% percentile places him near the very top globally, while Liverpool’s 92.9% reflects their strong reliance on rapid transitions—an ideal match for Klopp’s counter-heavy system.
    *   *Key Passes per 90:* Mané’s 88.9% aligns closely with Liverpool’s 95.9%, highlighting their shared ability to create chances and generate attacking opportunities.

Minor discrepancies in metrics like possession and pass completion don’t significantly inflate the PCA distance. Instead, the shared traits in dribbling, shots, and counterattacks form the foundation of their stylistic overlap.

## Mané’s Time at Liverpool

Sadio Mané’s arrival at Liverpool immediately transformed their attack. The PCA data pegged Liverpool as his 4th-best match across the top five leagues, reflecting their shared emphasis on quick transitions, dribbling, and high shot volume. Mané quickly became an integral part of Klopp’s high-pressing, counter-heavy system. His explosive pace, elite take-on ability, and relentless chance creation complemented Liverpool’s dynamic approach, resulting in an almost seamless integration. The synergy was immediate and long-lasting, demonstrating how closely the underlying data aligned with the tactical environment at Liverpool.

    *   *Shots per 90 & xG per 90:* Dembélé’s 2.154 shots (95.0%) and 0.259 xG (95.0%) underscore his aggressive attacking profile. Dortmund’s 91.8% for shots and 99.0% for xG reflect their high-volume attacking style, creating strong alignment in these areas.

*   **Defensive Engagement:**

    *   *Duel Success Rate:* Dembélé’s 34.4% percentile reflects a modest success rate in one-on-one situations, typical for a young winger focused on offense. Dortmund’s 69.4% percentile, as a team, indicates higher collective success in duels.
    *   *Interceptions per 90:* Dembélé’s 49.7% percentile contrasts with Dortmund’s low 6.1% percentile, which reflects their reliance on pressing triggers rather than traditional interceptions to regain possession.

Overall, the largest mismatches stem from possession and passing styles, while shared attacking traits, such as shots and dribbling, narrow the PCA distance.

## Dembélé’s Time at Borussia Dortmund

Dembélé joined Dortmund in 2016 after a breakout season at Rennes, and despite moderate mismatches in possession and passing, he adapted quickly to the team’s attacking approach. His explosive dribbling (99.7%) and ability to create key chances aligned well with Dortmund’s forward-thinking style.

*   **Progressive Passes & Dribbles:**

    *   *Gündoğan’s* 14.28 progressive passes per 90 (99.5%) and 1.92 dribbles per 90 (96.8%) align closely with City’s 80.11 progressive passes (92.9%) and 11.55 dribbles (94.9%), reflecting their shared emphasis on high-tempo, forward-looking play.

*   **Shots & xG:**

    *   *Gündoğan’s* 2.0 shots per 90 (93.5%) and 0.133 xG per 90 (83.1%) match City’s 15.41 shots (94.9%) and 1.621 xG (91.8%), showcasing a shared focus on creating high-quality chances.

*   **Pass Length & Fouls:**

    *   *Gündoğan’s* slightly longer pass length (19.13 yards, 62.2%) contrasts with City’s quick-passing ethos (18.33 yards, 6.1%), though this difference is minor.
    *   *City’s* 12.10 fouls per 90 (16.3%) highlight their use of tactical fouls, differing from Gündoğan’s 1.24 fouls (67.1%), which reflect a more restrained defensive style.

These metrics collectively highlight Gündoğan’s fit within Guardiola’s possession-heavy and progressive system.

While United appears closer in PCA distance, deeper analysis reveals notable differences:

*   **Possession & Progressive Passes:**

    *   *United’s* 0.580 possession rate (92.9%) and 78.23 progressive passes per 90 (89.8%) align moderately well with *Gündoğan’s* ball-dominant tendencies.

*   **Shots & Dribbles:**

    *   *Gündoğan’s* 2.0 shots per 90 (93.5%) and 1.92 dribbles per 90 (96.8%) highlight his attacking profile. *United’s* 27.6% for shots and 61.2% for dribbles indicate a more transitional style, relying less on sustained attacking output.

*   **Fouls & Set Piece xG:**

    *   *United’s* 13.37 fouls per 90 (31.6%) contrast with *Gündoğan’s* more measured defensive contributions (67.1%).
    *   *United’s* lower reliance on set-piece xG (0.512, 18.4%) further reflects differences in attacking style.

Alignment in pass length average likely influenced United’s closer PCA distance. However, key discrepancies in attacking metrics and transitional reliance highlight stylistic differences.

## Commentary, PCA Limitations, and Final Context

The PCA results showcase both strengths and limitations. While PCA effectively highlights broad stylistic trends, it can sometimes overemphasize certain metrics, such as pass length average, as seen in Gündoğan’s closer statistical alignment with Manchester United. This overemphasis can overshadow more critical differences in attacking metrics, such as dribbling and shot volume. Additionally, PCA lacks the nuance to capture tactical shifts, such as the significant evolution of Manchester City’s style under Guardiola compared to Pellegrini’s era, or the influence of managerial philosophies on team play.

Gündoğan’s seamless adaptation to Guardiola’s possession-centric system underscores the need to contextualize PCA findings with tactical and coaching factors. His proficiency in progressive passing, dribbling, and composure under pressure made him indispensable to City’s tactical evolution. Despite early injury setbacks, Gündoğan became a vital playmaker, illustrating why Guardiola identified him as a key signing and demonstrating that real-world fit often extends beyond statistical similarity.

---

## Strengths, Caveats, and Improvements for PCA

PCA is a powerful exploratory tool that uses events data to provide actionable insights without requiring detailed tactical annotations. By normalizing metrics into percentiles, it enables fair player and team comparisons, uncovering trends like Gündoğan’s fit with City or Mané’s synergy with Liverpool.

However, PCA has limitations. Overemphasis on dominant metrics, such as pass length average, can skew results, as seen with Gündoğan’s alignment with United. It also lacks tactical context, like pressing styles or managerial strategies, and may misalign team-level metrics with individual profiles.

To improve PCA, incorporating role-specific analysis, tactical variables (e.g., pressing intensity, formations), and clustering techniques for stylistic grouping could add depth. These enhancements would make PCA more effective for evaluating transfers and player-team compatibility.
