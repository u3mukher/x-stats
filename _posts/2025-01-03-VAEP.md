## Introduction to VAEP and Bayer Leverkusen's Unbeaten Season

Modern football analytics owes much to groundbreaking frameworks like **Valuing Actions by Estimating Probabilities (VAEP)**. Developed by researchers at KU Leuven, VAEP has revolutionized the way we understand player contributions by evaluating every on-ball action's impact on a team’s likelihood of scoring or conceding. This approach goes beyond goals and assists, shining a light on the often-overlooked moments that define matches and seasons. I extend my gratitude to the creators of VAEP for providing the tools to delve deeper into the intricacies of football performance.

For **Bayer Leverkusen**, VAEP offers a unique lens to analyze their extraordinary unbeaten campaign during the 2023/2024 Bundesliga season. Leverkusen didn’t just avoid defeat—they dominated matches, salvaged critical points, and epitomized resilience. Remarkably, this analysis doesn’t even include a loss category, underscoring the rarity of their accomplishment. Adding to their mystique, Leverkusen boasted a knack for scoring late, earning the nickname “Neverkusen.” A staggering 17 of their 86 league goals were scored after the 80th minute, exemplifying their ability to deliver in high-pressure situations *(courtesy StatsBomb event data)*.

In this analysis, I focus on data from the Bundesliga season provided by StatsBomb, categorizing matches into three result types: **Comfortable Wins**, **Close Wins**, and **Late Equalizer Draws**. The matches under consideration are:

### Comfortable Wins

1. **April 14, 2024:** Bayer Leverkusen 5-0 Werder Bremen
2. **November 12, 2023:** Bayer Leverkusen 4-0 Union Berlin
3. **February 10, 2024:** Bayer Leverkusen 3-0 Bayern Munich

### Close Wins

1. **November 4, 2023:** Hoffenheim 2-3 Bayer Leverkusen
2. **January 20, 2024:** RB Leipzig 2-3 Bayer Leverkusen
3. **August 19, 2023:** Bayer Leverkusen 3-2 RB Leipzig

### Late Equalizer Draws

1. **September 15, 2023:** Bayern Munich 2-2 Bayer Leverkusen
2. **April 27, 2024:** Bayer Leverkusen 2-2 VfB Stuttgart
3. **April 21, 2024:** Borussia Dortmund 1-1 Bayer Leverkusen

## Goals of the Analysis

The objective of this analysis is to uncover the patterns and dynamics behind Leverkusen’s unbeaten run. Specifically, I aim to:

1. **Understand positional contributions:** Evaluate how attackers, midfielders, defenders, and goalkeepers influenced outcomes across three result types.
2. **Analyze temporal dynamics:** Use cumulative VAEP line charts to examine how contributions evolved over the course of individual matches.
3. **Compare positional trends:** Leverage strip plots to assess the final cumulative VAEP contributions of each position category. These plots provide a comparative overview of positional influence, highlighting patterns of consistency or variability in contributions across selected matches.

By integrating cumulative VAEP line charts and strip plots, we can delve into the interplay between positional dynamics and match contexts, offering insights into how Leverkusen consistently adapted to diverse scenarios.
