# Analyzing Positional Contributions in Bayer Leverkusen’s Unbeaten Season with VAEP

Modern football analytics owes much to groundbreaking frameworks like Valuing Actions by Estimating Probabilities (VAEP). Developed by researchers at KU Leuven, VAEP has revolutionized the way we understand player contributions by evaluating every on-ball action's impact on a team’s likelihood of scoring or conceding. This approach goes beyond goals and assists, shining a light on the often-overlooked moments that define matches and seasons. We extend our gratitude to the creators of VAEP for providing the tools to delve deeper into the intricacies of football performance.

For Bayer Leverkusen, VAEP offers a unique lens to analyze their extraordinary unbeaten campaign during the 2023/2024 Bundesliga season. Leverkusen didn’t just avoid defeat—they dominated matches, salvaged critical points, and epitomized resilience. Remarkably, this analysis doesn’t even include a loss category, underscoring the rarity of their accomplishment. Adding to their mystique, Leverkusen boasted a knack for scoring late, earning the nickname “Neverkusen.” A staggering 17 of their 86 league goals were scored after the 80th minute, exemplifying their ability to deliver in high-pressure situations (courtesy Statsbomb event data).

In this analysis, we focus on data from the Bundesliga season provided by StatsBomb, categorizing matches into three result types: **Comfortable Wins**, **Close Wins**, and **Late Equalizer Draws**. The matches under consideration are:

### Comfortable Wins

## From Temporal Trends to Positional Distributions

Let’s now shift focus from the dynamic temporal trends captured in the cumulative VAEP line charts to aggregated positional contributions visualized through violin plots. While line charts illustrate how contributions evolve over time during individual matches, violin plots offer a summary of positional performance across the three games in each result category: Comfortable Wins, Close Wins, and Late Equalizer Draws. These plots display the final cumulative VAEP values for players in different positional categories—attackers, midfielders, defenders, and goalkeepers—highlighting the distribution, central tendencies, and variability of their contributions.

The violin plots feature distinct colors for each positional category, making it easy to discern patterns and outliers within each result type. Wider sections of the plots represent areas where VAEP values are more densely concentrated, indicating that many players have contributions within that range. If the wider sections are near the middle of the distribution, it suggests consistency in player contributions. In contrast, if the wider sections are spread across a broad range, it reflects variability in performance among players in that positional category. Understanding the precise width of a violin plot isn’t necessary; rather, these visualizations provide an intuitive snapshot of how players in each position influenced Leverkusen’s unbeaten campaign, emphasizing their roles in different match contexts.

## Summary

The combined insights from the cumulative VAEP line charts and violin plots reveal a fascinating narrative of Bayer Leverkusen’s unbeaten campaign. Across all result categories, midfielders stood out as the linchpin of the team, consistently bridging defense and attack. Their ability to adapt to match demands—whether dictating play in comfortable wins or orchestrating late comebacks in draws—underscored their pivotal role in maintaining control and creating opportunities. Midfielders’ versatility was evident in their contributions across all match types, highlighting their status as the team’s most reliable unit.

Defenders, too, provided critical stability throughout the campaign. In close wins, their decisive actions often turned the tide, as evidenced by their high average and maximum VAEP values. They also contributed meaningfully in comfortable victories, balancing defensive solidity with involvement in the buildup. The defenders’ consistent presence across matches ensured that Leverkusen had a strong foundation, even in high-pressure scenarios.

By contrast, attackers demonstrated variability in their contributions. They were most impactful in comfortable wins, where their moments of brilliance—captured by spikes in the line charts and higher VAEP maxima in the violin plots—helped Leverkusen capitalize on chances. However, in tighter matches, their influence waned, with lower average VAEP values reflecting sporadic contributions. This inconsistency highlights the attackers’ reliance on opportunities created by the midfield and defensive units.

Goalkeepers present the most nuanced story in this analysis. In comfortable wins, their involvement was minimal, as reflected by narrow VAEP distributions and near-neutral averages. This lack of activity speaks to Leverkusen’s dominance in these matches, where the defensive line often shielded the goalkeeper from significant threats. However, in close wins and late equalizer draws, goalkeepers faced greater challenges. Their VAEP values were often negative, penalized heavily for conceded goals, even when their performances were instrumental in keeping matches competitive. This limitation of VAEP reminds us to view goalkeeper contributions with nuance, acknowledging the critical off-the-ball actions that the metric doesn’t capture.
